\aufgabe{Feature importance without extrapolation}{
	Conditional Feature Importance and conditional SAGE value functions have been suggested as an alternative to Permutation Feature Importance. In contrast to PFI, the conditional sampling based techniques preserve the covariate joint distribution. Pick one of the two aforementioned methods, CFI or cSAGE value functions, and solve the following tasks for the method of your choice.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove formally that the prediction function is not evaluated outside the covariate joint $P(X)$.
    \item Implement the method of your choice, assuming that the data is stemming from a multivariate normal distribution.
    \item Apply the method to the dataset and model from Exercise 1. Compare the result.
\end{enumerate}
