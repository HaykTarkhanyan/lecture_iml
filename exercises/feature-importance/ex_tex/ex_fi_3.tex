\aufgabe{Refitting based importance}{
	We can also assess the importance of a feature by refitting the model with and without access. The method is also referred to as so-called leave-one-covariate-out (LOCO) importance.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement LOCO.
    \item Apply LOCO to the dataset from Exercise \ref{ex:pfi} (use an unregularized OLS model again).
    \item Interpret the result (insight into model and data). Compare the result to PFI, CFI and conditional SAGE value functions.
\end{enumerate}
