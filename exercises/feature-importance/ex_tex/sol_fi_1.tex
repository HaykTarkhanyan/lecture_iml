    \item \label{ex:when-problematic} Permutation Feature Importance resamples the feature of interest from its marginal distribution. As such, the feature is sampled without taking dependencies with the covariates into account. If the feature is independent of its covariates, i.e. if $X_j \perp X_{-j}$, then no dependencies must be taken into account.\\
    The main idea is that
    \begin{align}
        P(X) =  P(X_j, X_{-j})  &= P(X_j|X_{-j}) P(X_{-j}) & \text{follows from def. of cond. prob.} \\
        &= P(X_j) P(X_{-j}) & \text{follows from } X_j \perp X_{-j}\\
        &= P(\tilde{X}_j^{\emptyset}) P(X_{-j}) & \text{because } P(\tilde{X}_j^{\emptyset})  = P({X}_j)\\
        &= P(\tilde{X}_j^{\emptyset}, X_{-j}) & \text{follows from } \tilde{X}^{\emptyset}_j \perp X_{-j}
    \end{align}
    For more details on the interpreation of PFI under dependent features refer to \cite{konig_relative_2021}. 
    \item The proof is analog to \ref{ex:when-problematic}, only that $P(X_j|X_{-j}) \neq P(X_j)$ if $X_j \not \perp X_{-j}$.
