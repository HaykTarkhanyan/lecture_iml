Which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?  
	\begin{enumerate}
        \item Interpretation methods are \textit{only} used ot explain the global behavior of a model.
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item[$\Rightarrow$] \textbf{Wrong}, there are several needs for interpretability. (Gain global and local insights how the IML model works, better control, improve and debug the IML model, justify decisions)
        \end{itemize}
        %\item Model-agnostic methods need access to gradients to explain a model. 
%        \begin{itemize}
%        	\item[$\Rightarrow$] \textbf{Wrong}, not every model-agnostic model uses gradients.
%        \end{itemize}
    	\item If a model-agnostic and a model-specific interpretation method are applied on the same ML model, the output of the two methods will always be the same.
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item[$\Rightarrow$] \textbf{Wrong}, as the methods work different they will probably give a divergent output.
    	\end{itemize}
    	\item While feature effects methods show the influence of a feature on the target, feature importance methods focus on a feature's impact on the model performance.
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item[$\Rightarrow$] \textbf{Correct}.
    	\end{itemize}
    	\item In IML we distinguish between global IML methods, which explain the behavior of the model over the entire feature space, and local IML methods, which only explain the prediction of individual observations. 
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item[$\Rightarrow$] \textbf{Correct}.
    	\end{itemize}
%        \item We can also draw conclusions about feature importance from feature effect methods. 
%        \begin{itemize}
%        	\item[$\Rightarrow$] \textbf{Correct}, but it should be noted that this does not hold vice versa.
%        \end{itemize}
        \item Technically, Pearson correlation is a measure of \textit{linear} statistical dependence. 
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item[$\Rightarrow$] \textbf{Correct}.
        \end{itemize}
    	\item All in the lecture mentioned measures for correlation and dependencies are limited to continuous random variables.
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item[$\Rightarrow$] \textbf{Wrong}, mutual information is not limited to continuous random variables.
    	\end{itemize}
%        \item Features that have an equal feature effect are correlated. 
%        \begin{itemize}
%        	\item[$\Rightarrow$] \textbf{Wrong}, as correlation is a measure of linear dependence and feature effects can also be based on non-linear dependencies.
%        \end{itemize}
    	\item A feature interaction between two features $x_j$ and $x_k$ is apparent if a change in $x_j$ influences the impact of $x_k$ on the target.
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item[$\Rightarrow$] \textbf{Correct}.
    	\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
