\aufgabe{LIME}{
LIME is a local feature effect method that is based on locally approximating the decision function using a linear model. Then, the linear model coefficients are interpreted as usual. Like SHAP, LIME is an additive attribution technique.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement LIME.
    \item Try different hyperparameter configurations.
    \item Compare result to SHAP. Feature interactions?
\end{enumerate}
