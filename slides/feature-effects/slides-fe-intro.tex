%Here,

%Here, the marginal effect of a feature $x_j$ does not vary across observations and is quantified by its associated coefficient $\hat\beta_j$. %, which explains how a feature affects the model prediction.

%The $\hat\beta$-coefficients are constant across different observations.
%It is sufficient to consider a feature's $\hat\beta$ coefficient as marginal effect as it provides an understanding how a feature affects the model prediction. % on average.

% \textbf{Example}: %Visualizing the marginal effect of a LM (left) and a GAM (right) with a single feature (temperature) to predict the number of bike rentals.
% Feature effect of LM (left) visualizes relationship of a single feature (here: temperature) on prediction (here: number of bike rentals) while ignoring all other features.
% GAM (right) replaces linear terms $x_j\hat\beta_j$ of LM by non-linear functions $f_j(x_j)$ estimated via splines.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Interactions: Feature effect is modified by other features and varies across observations \\ 
    $\Rightarrow$ Example: effect of temperature varies across seasons
    \item ML models estimate non-linear effects and interactions \\
    $\Rightarrow$ Need for local feature effect methods

% %If the model contains interactions, the slope of the regression line (in case of LMs) or the shape of the partial effect curve (in case of GAMs) will be different for certain observations.

% \textbf{Example}: If we include the interaction \texttt{temp*season},
% %the marginal effect of \texttt{temp} will depend on \texttt{season}. That is,
% observations belonging to a certain category of \texttt{season} will have different marginal effects (slopes) for \texttt{temp}.
