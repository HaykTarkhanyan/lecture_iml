\begin{vbframe}{LIME}
\begin{itemize}
		\item Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) assume that even if a machine learning model is very complex, the local prediction can be described with a simpler model.
		\item  Therefore, LIME explains \textbf{individual} predictions of \textbf{any} black-box model by approximating the model \textbf{locally} with an interpretable models.
		\item These approximations are called local surrogate models. Typically, they are linear models or trees.
		\item They should answer why a machine learning model predicted $Y$ for input $\xv$.
		\item Since they can be applied to any black-box model they are model-agnostic.  
		\item They can handle tabular, image and text data. 
\end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Formal Definition}
	LIME provides a local explanation for a black-box model $f$ in form of a model $g \in \Gspace$ with $\Gspace$ as the class of potential (interpretable) models. This model $g$ should have two characteristics:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item It should be \textbf{interpretable}, i.e. provide qualitative understanding between the input variables and the response that are easy to understand.  
		\item It should be \textbf{locally faithful}, i.e. it should behave similarly to $f$ in the vicinity of the instance being predicted. This characteristic is also called local fidelity. 
	\end{enumerate}
	Formally, we want to receive a model $g$ with minimal complexity and maximal local-fidelity. 
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Model Complexity}
We can measure the complexity of a model $g$ using $\Omega(g)$. \\ 
\vspace{0.5cm}
 	\textbf{Example: Linear regression model}\\
 	Let $\Gspace = \left\{g: \Xspace \to \R ~|~g(\xv) = \thetab^\top \xv\right\}$ be the class of linear models then $\Omega(g) = \sum_{j = 1}^p \I_{[\theta_j \neq 0]}$ could be the number of non-zero coefficients. 
 	\vspace{0.5cm}
 	
 	\textbf{Example: Tree}\\
 	Let $\Gspace = \left\{g:\Xspace \to \R ~|~g(\xv) = \sum_{m=1}^M c_m \I(x \in Q_m)\right\}$ be the class of trees (i.e., class of additive model over the leaf-rectangles) then $\Omega(g)$ could measure the number of terminal/leaf nodes.\\
 	\end{vbframe}
 
 	\begin{vbframe}{Local model fidelity}
 		\begin{itemize}
 			\item A model $g$ is locally faithful to $f$ with respect to an instance $\xv$ if for instances $\zv$ in the vicinity of $\xv$ the predictions of $g(\zv)$ are close to $f(\zv)$. 
 			 \item We can rephrase that in an optimization task: the closer $\zv$ is to $\xv$, the closer $g(\xv)$ should be to $f(\zv)$.  
 			\item For this definition we need two measures:
 			\begin{enumerate}
 				\item A proximity measure $\neigh(\zv)$ between $\zv$ and $\xv$, e.g. the exponential kernel which converts any distance measure into a similarity measure 
 				$$\pi_x(\zv) = exp(-d(\xv, \zv)^2/\sigma^2)$$ 
 				with $\sigma$ as the kernel width. $d$ could be for example the Euclidean distance (numeric features) or the Gower distance (mixed features). 
 				\item A distance measure $d_{g, f}(\zv)$ to assess how close the predictions of $f(\zv)$ and $g(\zv)$ are, e.g. the squared loss $$d_{g,f}(\zv) = (g(\zv) - f(\zv))^2.$$ 
 			\end{enumerate}
 			\item Given points $\zv \in Z$, we can measure local fidelity of $g$ with respect to $f$ in terms of a weighted loss
 			$$L(f, g, \neigh) = \sum_{z \in Z} \neigh(\zv) d_{g,f}(\zv)$$
 		\end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Minimization task}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Formally, an explanation produced by LIME is obtained by the following: 
		$$ \argmin_{g \in \Gspace} L(f, g, \neigh) + \Omega(g)$$
		\item In practice, LIME only optimizes $L(f, g, \neigh)$ (model-fidelity). 	
		\item The complexity is determined by users beforehand by restricting the class $\Gspace$. For example, users could only consider sparse linear models. 
		\item Since we want a \textbf{model-agnostic} explainer, we need to optimize $L(f, g, \neigh)$ without making any assumptions about $f$. 
		\item Therefore, we learn $g$ only approximately with the following algorithm.  
		\end{itemize}
\end{vbframe} 

\begin{vbframe}{LIME Algorithm}
		For the algorithm, we need a pre-trained model $f$, $\xv$ whose prediction we want to explain and model class $\Gspace$.\\ \vspace{0.5cm}
		We illustrate the steps of the algorithm with a classification example: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The light/dark gray background represents the prediction surface of classifier $f: \R^2 \to \{0, 1\}$.
			\item The yellow point displays $\xv$ we are interested in. 
			\item $\Gspace$ is restricted to the class of logistic regression models

		\begin{itemize} 
			\item Randomly sample new instances. 
			\item Use the training data set with or without perturbations.

\begin{vbframe}{LIME for Text Data}
	So far, we focused on tabular data but LIME could also be applied to text data: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each instance is represented as a binary vector indicating the presence or absence of a word.
		\item Starting from the original text, new samples $\zv$ are created by randomly removing words from the original text.
		\item An exponential kernel with cosine distance could be used as a proximity measure. 
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{vbframe}{LIME for image data}
	LIME also works for image data:  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each instance is represented as a binary vector indicating the presence or absence of superpixels. 
		\item Superpixels are interconnected pixels with similar colors. They are used because a single pixel would probably not change a prediction by much.
		\item Starting from the original image, new samples $\zv$ are created by randomly turning ``superpixels" off or on (uniformly coloring). 
		\item An exponential kernel with L2 distance could be used as a proximity measure.

\begin{vbframe}{Pitfalls}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item LIME is one of the best known interpretable machine learning methods but several papers caution to be careful in their use. 
  	\item Problems can occur in several places. These are discussed in more detail below. 
  \end{itemize}
	\textbf{Pitfall 1: Sampling}
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item The most common sampling strategies for $\zv \in Z$ do not take the correlation between features into account. 
      \item This can lead to unlikely data points which can then be used to learn local explanation models.
      \item An easy solution would be to use the original training data to fit the surrogate model but it only works well with larger amounts of data. 
    \end{itemize}
\framebreak
	\textbf{Pitfall 2: Locality}
	\begin{itemize} 
     \item It is difficult to define locality (= how samples are weighted locally). It has a huge influence on the local model, but there is no automatic procedure for choosing the neighborhood. 
     \item The authors of LIME proposed an exponential smoothing kernel to define the neighborhood. 
     Until now there is not a good way to find a good kernel and kernel width. 
     \item A small kernel width means that an instance must be very close to influence the local model, a larger kernel width means that instances that are farther away also influence the model. 
     \item In certain scenarios, you can easily turn your explanation around by changing the kernel width. This is illustrated on the next slide. 
   \end{itemize}
	\framebreak
  \begin{columns}
  \begin{column}{0.47\textwidth}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In the figure, the predictions of the black box model depending on a single feature $x$ is shown as a thick line. The distribution of the data is shown with rugs.
    \item Three local surrogate models with different kernel widths are computed.

      \end{center}
  \end{column}
\end{columns}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The resulting linear regression model heavily depends on the kernel width.
	\item A better alternative is the Gower proximity. It is often the default method in software packages.

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Pitfalls}

\textbf{Pitfall 3: Local vs. global features}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There exist two types of features: Features with a \textbf{global} influence that influence the global shape of the black-box model and features with a \textbf{local} influence that impact predictions for a small area of the whole features space. 
	\item Im most LIME implementations, new instances are sampled from the whole input space and are not taken around the instance of interest $\xv$.
	\item Laugel et al. (2018) showed that this tends to hide the features with a local influence for the benefit of features with a global influence in classification problems. 
	\framebreak
	\item The authors propose to sample new instances $\zv$ precisely around the decision boundary closest from point $\xv$ for higher local accuracy of the surrogate model.

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Pitfalls}
\textbf{Pitfall 4: Faithfulness}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There exists a trade-off between local fidelity vs. sparsity. 
	\item If the local fidelity of our interpretable model is low, we do not receive reliable explanations.
	\item On the other hand, high fidelity is only possible with a more complex model bearing the risk to substitute a black-box by another.
	\item It should also be noted that identifying \textbf{locally} faithful explanations that are interpretable is less of a challenge than identifying \textbf{globally} faithful explanations. 
	\item Yet, global fidelity implies local fidelity but not vice versa. 
\end{itemize}
\framebreak

\textbf{Pitfall 5: Possibility to hide biases}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Slack et al. (2020) showed that data scientist could manipulate their model to hide biases. 
	\item They make use of the fact that sampled instances to build the surrogate model are out of the input data distribution if we do not account for feature dependencies. 
	\item They built a classifier that detects whether a given data point is an out-of-distribution sample or not. 
	\item If the sample is out-of-distribution (usually samples for the surrogate models), an unbiased predictor is used, otherwise a biased on. 
	\item Since the surrogate model is trained on samples whose target values are derived from an unbiased predictor, the explanations do not detect any bias although the original predictor is biased.

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Pitfalls}
\textbf{Pitfall 6: Robustness}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Another really big problem is the instability of the explanations. 
	\item Explanations of two very close points could vary greatly. 
	\item But also if $\xv$ is fixed and only new sampled data sets $Z$ are used, the resulting explanations could differ.  
\end{itemize}

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Pitfalls}
\textbf{Pitfall 7: Definition of superpixels}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Another source of instability concerns the definition of superpixels for image data. 
	\item Multiple definitions of superpixels exist and these definitions influence both the shape and size. 
	\item The definition of superpixel has a large influence on the explanations. 
	\item Furthermore, if superpixel are only slightly changed (adversarial attack), the definitions could still differ greatly.  
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion: LIME should only be used with great caution.}
