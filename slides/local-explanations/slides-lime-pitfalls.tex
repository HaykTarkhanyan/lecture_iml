\begin{vbframe}{LIME Pitfalls}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item LIME is one of the best known interpretable machine learning methods but several papers caution to be careful in their use. 
  	\item Problems can occur in several places. These are discussed in more detail below. 
  \end{itemize}
	\textbf{Pitfall 1: Sampling}
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item The most common sampling strategies for $\zv \in Z$ do not take the correlation between features into account. 
      \item This can lead to unlikely data points which can then be used to learn local explanation models.
      \item Ideally, we need a local sampler that samples $\zv$ from $\Xspace$. However, its derivation is particularly difficult for high dimensional or mixed feature spaces. 
      \item We could use the original training data to fit the surrogate model, but this only works well with enough data near $\xv$.
    \end{itemize}
\framebreak
	\textbf{Pitfall 2: Locality}
	\begin{itemize} 
     \item It is difficult to define locality (= how samples are weighted locally). It has a huge influence on the local model, but there is no automatic procedure for choosing the neighborhood.
     \item The authors of LIME proposed an exponential kernel as proximity measure between $\xv$ and $\zv$:
     	$\neigh(\zv) = exp(-d(\xv, \zv)^2/\sigma^2)$ where $d$ is a distance measure and $\sigma$ is the kernel width. 
     	 \begin{center}
     		\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figure/lime_locality}
     		\vspace{-0.5cm}
     		
     		\scriptsize{\textbf{Figure:} Linear surrogate models for two different data points based on the same model with one target and one feature. Each line displays one linear surrogate model with a different kernel width. In the right figure larger, kernel sizes are more severe.}
     		
     	\end{center}
     \item A larger kernel width means that instances that are farther away also influence the model such that we do not receive a local but a global surrogate model. 
     \item Therefore, we prefer smaller kernel widths such that an instance must be very close to influence the local model.  
     \item If the kernel with is set too small, we only fit a local model based on a few observations which carries the risk to fit noise.   
	\item Multiple software package use another default standardized distance: the Gower proximity where no kernel width needs to be specified. However, experiments showed that since also data points far away receive a weight $ > 0$, their resulting explanations are rather global surrogates than local surrogates.   
\end{itemize}

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{LIME Pitfalls}

\textbf{Pitfall 3: Local vs. global features}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There exist two types of features: Features with a \textbf{global} influence that influence the global shape of the black-box model and features with a \textbf{local} influence that impact predictions for a small area of the whole features space. 
	\item For example in decision trees, splitting variables close to the root have a more global influence than the ones close to the leaves. 
	\item Im most LIME implementations, new instances are sampled from the whole input space and are not taken around $\xv$.
	\item Laugel et al. (2018) showed that this tends to hide the features with a local influence for the benefit of features with a global influence even when the kernel width was reduced. 
	\item Instead of global sampling, the authors propose to sample new instances $\zv$ precisely around the decision boundary closest from point $\xv$ for higher local accuracy of the surrogate model. 
\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item E.g., let us explain the prediction of the green dot (right figure). Background colors display predictions of a random forest. 
		\item The decision boundary of LIME with default kernel width (green line) does not match the direction of the steeper local boundary. 
		\item LIME with reduced kernel width (blue line) performs a bit better but still does not approximate the local border properly. 
		\item The method of Laugel et al. (2018) (red line) approximates the local border direction better. The red dot is the point closest to the border detected by this method.

\begin{vbframe}{LIME Pitfalls}
\textbf{Pitfall 4: Faithfulness}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There exists a trade-off between local fidelity vs. sparsity. 
	\item If the local fidelity of our interpretable model is low, we do not receive reliable explanations.
	\item On the other hand, high fidelity is only possible with a more complex model bearing the risk to substitute a black-box by complex model that is difficult to interpret.
\end{itemize}
\framebreak

\textbf{Pitfall 5: Possibility to hide biases}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Slack et al. (2020) showed that data scientist could manipulate their model to hide biases. 
	\item They make use of the fact that sampled instances to build the surrogate model are out of the input data distribution if we do not account for feature dependencies. 
	\item They built a classifier that detects whether a given data point is an out-of-distribution sample or not. 
	\item If the sample is out-of-distribution (usually samples for the surrogate models), an unbiased predictor is used, otherwise a biased on. 
	\item Since the surrogate model is trained on samples whose target values are derived from an unbiased predictor, the explanations do not detect any bias although the original predictor is biased.

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{LIME Pitfalls}
\textbf{Pitfall 6: Robustness}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Another really big problem is the instability of the explanations. 
	\item Explanations of two very close points could vary greatly. 
	\item But also if $\xv$ is fixed and only new sampled data sets $Z$ are used, the resulting explanations could differ.  
\end{itemize}

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{LIME Pitfalls}
\textbf{Pitfall 7: Definition of superpixels}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Another source of instability concerns the definition of superpixels for image data. 
	\item Multiple definitions of superpixels exist and these definitions influence both the shape and size. 
	\item The definition of superpixel has a large influence on the explanations. 
	\item Furthermore, if superpixel are only slightly changed (adversarial attack), the definitions could still differ greatly.  
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion: LIME should only be used with great caution.}
